# Bookmarky
ðŸ“” A sleek and simple bookmark manager

Current version: **NOT YET RELEASED**

**Bookmarky** is an easy-to-use application to collect and manage bookmarks and notes. It's inspired by other similar bookmark managers that are either too bloated for my tastes, don't have the features I want, or just don't look nice. So I decided to make my own!

## Demo
You can see a [demo of Bookmarky](https://besa.uber.space/projects/bookmarky/) on my website.

## How to use
TBA.

## Features
Currently, only the UI is (almost) done but with no functionality yet. The first finished version will allow you to save links from the web with tags which you can add, edit and customize.

**Planned features:**  
â¬œ Maybe do away with the tags entirely and instead use tags with multi-filtering?  
â¬œ Preview image in saved links  
â¬œ Synchronization between devices  
â¬œ Browser plugin to save links via context menu  
â¬œ Mobile app  
â¬œ Notes (similar to Google Keep)

If you have any more ideas or feature requests, feel free to let me know!
